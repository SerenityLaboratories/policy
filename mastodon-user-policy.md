# Mastodon User Policy (MUP)

Welcome to deadinsi.de! We're happy you're considering to toot with us and taking the time to read our policy.

## Scope and Audience

This policy is for users who have their accounts on deadinsi.de. There is a seperate peering policy for deciding when and how to federate with other instances. Generally, for users on the instance a higher standard applies.

Our instance is only available to users for personal use. Accounts with a commercial background should look elsewhere. Promoting your own work is okay, as long as it is not the focus of your account.

## Intent and Remedies

Our guiding principle for remedies is that of intent and willingness to correct ones own behavior. It is okay if you fuck up. But we expect you to correct your behavior as soon as we point it out.

Please approch the moderation team with any issues or questions about this policy, or any other policy in this document. We're always happy to expand in the rationale of these policies and provide advice about being excellent to each other.

If you disagree and reject our requests to fix your behavior, maybe this isn't the right instance for you. 

## Banned Content

Content that is illegal in Finland or Germany is subject to suspensions. Independent from their legal status, any depictions of minors in a sexual context, real or imagined, is banned and will lead to suspensions.

## Prohibited Content

We have a zero-tolerance policy against bigoted behavior. This especially includes, but is not limited to racism, sexism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, transphobia and ableism.

Do not explicitly endorse systems of opression as a remedy to the same. This especially applies to the myth of meritocracy.

Do not argue for the existence or relevance of reverse-racism or reverse-sexism. Racism and sexism are deep structural issues with culture and not the expression of single persons.

## Content Warnings

We ask all users to make use of the Content Warning ("CW") feature in Mastodon extensively. While this is a hard requirement for any adult or disturbing content, particularly involving discussion about prohibited content, we highly encourage using it as a general disclaimer regarding the content of your toot.

If someone asks you to add a warning to a particular type of content, it is generally a good idea to follow through.

## Personal Pronouns

We highly encourage you to add your pronouns to your profile and check your fellow users profiles for pronouns before engaging in conversation with them.

## Discussions and Debate

If you want to start an argument, it is better to ask if the person you're engaging would be interested in hearing your take first. We're trying to build a space where everyone feels comfortable being themselves, not a debate club. When you're asked to disengage, do so.
