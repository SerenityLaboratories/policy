## Mastodon Peering Policy

Welcome to deadinsi.de! We're happy you're considering to toot with us and taking the time to read our policy.

### Scope

This policy is for anyone on the fediverse who wants to interact with our users or join our relay. There is a separate user policy for accounts hosted on deadinsi.de.

### Banned Content

Content that is illegal in Finland or Germany is subject to suspensions. Independent from their legal status, any depictions of minors in a sexual context, real or imagined, is banned and will lead to suspensions. For instances where such content is legal, a media block silence is enforced instead.

### Prohibited Content

We have a zero-tolerance policy against bigoted behavior. This especially includes, but is not limited to racism, sexism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, transphobia and ableism.

Instances that do not moderate such content might be silenced or suspended, based on severity. Outright fascism for instance will be suspended, while reactionary ideology will usually be silenced.

### Harassment

Instances hosting users that do not follow our "disengage on request" policy or send messages that can be construed to fall into our definition of prohibited content may be silenced or suspended based on severity. If the severity is not too high the user should be silenced or suspended first before a grace period where the instance moderation team is given time to rectify the situation.
